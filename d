I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing again to follow up on several key topics that have been pending since August 2, 2024. Despite my previous attempts to reach out, these matters remain unresolved, and I would appreciate your earliest attention to them.

The specific points that need to be addressed are as follows:

Demo Feedback Changes: The feedback from both the 30th of June and the 1st of July is still pending with FSL. It is crucial that we review these changes to proceed.

Harmonized Job Sheet: The structure of the harmonized job sheet differs significantly from the initially shared sheet. Additionally, the color coding used for different Business Units (BUs) is confusing and appears to be incorrect.

Counter Sale Screen: The new logic for the counter sale screen has been developed, along with other small changes. These updates are pending your review and approval.

I kindly request that you let me know your availability so that we can connect and resolve these issues as soon as possible. Your prompt response would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
